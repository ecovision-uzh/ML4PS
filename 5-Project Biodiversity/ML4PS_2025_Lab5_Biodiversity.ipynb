    "# Lab-5: Project Biodiversity\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab dives into a specific research application of environmental data science: Species Distribution Modeling. You will need to interact with with new data and define your own code structure to compare various methods on it. Please reference the overview slides for more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Announcements\n",
    "\n",
    "* The exercises is **ungraded** and determines the pass/fail for **Module 2**.\n",
    "* Team work is not allowed! Everybody implements his/her own code. Discussing issues with others is fine, sharing code with others is not. \n",
    "* If you use any code fragments found on the Internet, make sure you reference them properly.\n",
    "* You can send your questions via email to Johannes (johannes.dollinger@uzh.ch).\n",
    "* Deadline: Friday, 12th of December at midnight\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we do not provide any code skeleton, therefore you will need to write all code from scratch. This simulates the situation you will find yourself in when tackling real applied problems. Feel free to reference previous labs for their code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the data (*train_po/SWItrain_po.csv*, *test_env/SWItest_env.csv* and *test_pa/SWItest_pa.csv*) and familiarize yourself with them, including analyzing their value & class distribution. See *train_po/01_metadata_SWItrain_po.csv* for an explanation of the predictors. You will need to pre-process the data for your modeling, but do not need to apply filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Train two classic (non-neural) models on the PO-data. You may take inspiration from previous labs or the list of methods used in the [original publication](https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.2006.0906-7590.04596.x)[1]. Produce predictions for the PA-data and receive the accuracy and [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score) from the Tester-class provided in tester.py. Make sure to try out different hyperparameters in both this and the next section to improve your models performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now design and train a small neural network on the PO-data, scoring it again on the PA-data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial Implicit Neural Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Test out training a neural network using the [SINR AN-full loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02564)[2]. You may use the *train_bg* folders files as the samples at random locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the results from the different models and propose improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus: Results Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the experiments for all six regions in the provided data and put the results into a proper (Latex) table as commonly seen in publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important:\n",
    "* Make sure to train on the PO-data and to test on the PA-data using the provided test-function.\n",
    "* If your laptop cannot handle the Swiss datas size, you can switch to a different region.\n",
    "* It is your own choice which combination of predictors you want to use in modeling, including whether to make the model location-explicit or just climatic.\n",
    "* Note that \"swi01\" is referenced as species[0] due to arrays starting with index 0, but the class-counting starting at 1.\n",
    "* Note that you will need to decide how to turn a probabilistic output (e.g. from a neural network) into a 0/1-binary prediction for calculating the test scores.\n",
    "* You will not be graded on the absolute performance of your methods, but it should be evident that you properly used & tested them.\n",
    "* **Please submit the ML4PS_2025_Lab5_Biodiversity.ipynb and any new auxiliary files on through mail.**\n",
